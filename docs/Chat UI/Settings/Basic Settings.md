# Basic Settings for Chat UI

The Chat UI's basic settings provide essential tools for customizing your interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). These settings are designed to be straightforward, offering a balance between simplicity and flexibility.

## Select Model Dropdown

This dropdown allows you to choose from a variety of pre-loaded LLMs. Each model comes with its unique strengths and capabilities, enabling you to tailor your experience to your specific needs or interests.

## Upload Custom Model

If the pre-loaded options don't meet your requirements, you have the option to upload a custom model. This feature provides the flexibility to experiment with your own LLMs or those not listed in the default selection.

## Select Top N Knowledge Fragments

Specify the number of top knowledge fragments (pieces of information) the model should consider when generating a response. This setting helps refine the model's focus, ensuring it leverages the most relevant information.

## Upload File

Upload a specific file to provide context or additional information for the model to use in its responses. This is particularly useful for tasks requiring detailed input, such as summarizing a document or answering questions based on a specific text.

## Upload Folder

Similar to uploading a file, this option allows you to upload an entire folder. This is ideal for tasks that require the model to access and process information from multiple documents.

## Knowledge Fragments Toggle

Choose between sourcing knowledge fragments from a local database or indexing all available information. This toggle affects how the model searches for and selects information to use in its responses, allowing for either more focused or broader explorations.

## System Prompt Text Box

Enter a prompt or question in the text box to initiate the conversation with the selected LLM. The system prompt sets the context and direction for the interaction, guiding the model's responses based on your input.

These basic settings are designed to get you started quickly while still providing the ability to customize the Chat UI experience. Experiment with different configurations to discover what works best for your objectives.
